# Iris_dataset_project
This project involves using the famous Iris Flower Dataset to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. The dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify these observations into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a simple yet powerful example of using machine learning for classification tasks. The project leverages the scikit-learn library to build and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is included in the datasets module of the scikit-learn library and contains the following features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)
You can install these libraries using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris_Flower_Classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd Iris_Flower_Classification
Run the main script to train and test the model:
sh
Copy code
python main.py
Model
The model used for this project is a simple yet effective Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The steps to build and evaluate the model are as follows:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the SVM model on the training data.
Evaluate the model on the testing data.
Predict the species of new iris flower observations.
Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are printed to the console and can be visualized using matplotlib.
