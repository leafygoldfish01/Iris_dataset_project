# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves using the famous Iris Flower Dataset to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. The dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify these observations into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project is a simple yet powerful example of using machine learning for classification tasks. The project leverages the scikit-learn library to build and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in the `datasets` module of the scikit-learn library and contains the following features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)

The Iris dataset was introduced by Sir Ronald A. Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems".//
This project uses the scikit-learn library, which provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
